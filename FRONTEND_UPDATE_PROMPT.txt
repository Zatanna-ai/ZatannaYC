# Update Frontend to Match Backend Discover-YC Endpoint

I need to update the frontend search functionality to match my existing backend endpoint structure. Here's what I need from you:

## Current Frontend Implementation
The frontend is currently making this request:
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/discover-yc`
- **Headers**: `Content-Type: application/json`, `Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}`
- **Request Body**:
```json
{
  "query": "string",
  "num_results": 20
}
```

The frontend is currently expecting this response structure:
```typescript
{
  data: {
    top_founders: Array<{
      person_id: string
      name: string
      profile_picture_url?: string
      matched_occupation?: string
      occupation_score?: number
      criteria_score?: number
      combined_score?: number
      matching_entities?: string[]
    }>
  }
}
```

## What I Need
Please provide the ACTUAL structure of your backend endpoint:

1. **What is the exact endpoint path?** (is it `/api/v1/discover-yc` or something else?)

2. **What request body fields does it expect?**
   - Required fields?
   - Optional fields?
   - Any field name differences?

3. **What is the actual response structure?**
   - Is it wrapped in `{ data: {...} }` or is it flat?
   - What is the array of founders called? (`top_founders`, `results`, `founders`, etc.?)
   - What fields does each founder object have?
   - Are there any other fields in the response?

4. **What does a real response look like?** (paste an example)

5. **Authentication**: 
   - Is Bearer token required?
   - What header format? (`Authorization: Bearer {token}`?)

6. **Error responses**: What format do errors use?

Once you provide this info, I'll update the frontend code to match exactly.
