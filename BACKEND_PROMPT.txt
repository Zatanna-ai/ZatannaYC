# Backend API Integration for YC Batch Report Frontend

I need to wire up my Next.js frontend (running on localhost:4000) to your backend API (running on localhost:3000). Here are the exact requirements:

## Base Configuration
- Backend URL: http://localhost:3000
- API Version: /api/v1
- CORS: Must allow requests from http://localhost:4000

## Required Endpoints

### 1. GET /api/v1/yc-batch/stats
Returns aggregated batch statistics. Response should include:
- total_founders: number
- education: array of {university, count, percentage}
- interests: array of {activity, canonical_name, count, percentage, intensity_breakdown}
- geography: array of {location, count, percentage, type}
- occupations: array of {title, canonical_name, count, percentage, industry, role_level}
- other_stats: {avg_interests_per_founder, most_common_combinations, platform_distribution}

### 2. GET /api/v1/yc-batch/founders
Returns array of all founders. Each founder should have:
- person_id (UUID)
- name
- linkedin_url? (optional)
- profile_picture_url? (optional)
- interests: array of {activity, canonical_name, intensity: 'casual'|'enthusiast'|'serious'|'professional', confidence, sources}
- occupations: array of {title, canonical_name, employer, employment_type, role_level, industry, functional_area, status, confidence}
- universities: string[]
- high_schools: string[]
- locations: string[]
- companies: string[]
- datapoints: array of {url, title?, snippet?, datapoint_id, platform?}
- research_summary? (optional)

Response can be either:
- Direct array: Founder[]
- Or wrapped: {founders: Founder[]}

### 3. GET /api/v1/yc-batch/founders/:personId
Returns single founder with same structure as above. Return 404 if not found.

### 4. POST /api/v1/discover-yc
Semantic search endpoint. Requires Bearer token auth.

Request body:
{
  query: string (e.g., "CTOs who went to Michigan")
  num_results?: number (default 20)
  organization_id?: string
}

Response:
{
  success: boolean
  data: {
    query: string
    parsed_query?: {...}
    founders_found: number
    top_founders: Array<{
      person_id, name, profile_picture_url?,
      matched_occupation?, occupation_score?, criteria_score?, combined_score?,
      matching_entities?, subject_datapoints?, criteria_datapoints?
    }>
    elapsed_time_ms?: number
  }
}

## CORS Setup
Must allow:
- Origin: http://localhost:4000
- Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS
- Headers: Content-Type, Authorization

## Notes
- All responses should be JSON with Content-Type: application/json
- Frontend has fallback to mock data if API unavailable, so can implement incrementally
- Use standard HTTP status codes (200, 404, 401, 500)

Please implement these endpoints and let me know when ready. I'll test by setting NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000 in the frontend.
